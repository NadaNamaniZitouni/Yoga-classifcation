# Yoga-classifcation
Classification of yoga poses from provided images. 
This repo was created to illustrate a task provided as a competition between groups. 
In this work, the only demand was to use a CNN architecture.
In this repo, we used both the pretrained resnet and created a resnet from scratch and used the VGG16 architecture to make a comparison.
The datasets used are publicly available on kaggle.
